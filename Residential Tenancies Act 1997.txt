        211A        Further matters to be considered by Tribunal
        (1)        Subsection (2) applies in respect of an application for compensation for damage to—
        (a)        rented premises under a residential rental agreement; and
        (b)        a rooming house, including a room or common areas of the rooming house; and
        (c)        a caravan park, caravan or movable dwelling; and
        (d)        a Part 4A park or a Part 4A site.
        (2)        In calculating an amount of compensation payable by a renter, a resident or a site tenant (as the case requires) on an application referred to in subsection (1), the Tribunal must take into account any depreciation of the damaged part of the property referred to in subsection (1)(a), (b), (c) or (d) by having regard to—
        (a)        the Uniform Capital Allowance System; or
        (b)        any other prescribed scale.
        (3)        In calculating an amount of compensation payable on an application under section 210 or 210B for early termination of a residential rental agreement by the renter, or of a site agreement by the site tenant, the Tribunal must—
        (a)        determine advertising costs and reletting fees (if any) incurred by the residential rental provider or the site owner (as the case requires) on a basis that is proportionate to the actual cost of securing the renter or the site tenant; and
Example
A renter has lived in rented premises under a residential rental agreement, on terms including a 12 month fixed term, rent of $500 per week and a reletting fee of $500. The renter notifies the property manager that the renter will terminate the rental agreement 6 months before the end of the fixed term. The property manager advertises the rented premises for rent immediately and finds a new renter. The advertising costs were $250. The new renter enters the premises one week after the previous renter vacates the premises. The residential rental provider's costs of advertising and reletting fees are $1000, which is the sum of one week's rent ($500), the reletting fee pro-rated for 6 months of the unexpired term of the agreement ($250) and advertising costs ($250).
        (b)        determine the amount of compensation for loss of rent (if any) by taking into account what loss could reasonably have been mitigated by the residential rental provider or the site owner (as the case requires) by promptly reletting the rented premises or the Part 4A site; and
        (c)        have regard to any severe hardship the renter or the site tenant would have been expected to suffer due to an unforseen change in circumstances, if the residential rental agreement or site agreement had continued; and
        (d)        not award any compensation for loss of future rent to the residential rental provider, or the site owner (as the case requires), if the residential rental provider or the site owner served a notice to vacate on the renter or the site tenant, unless the notice was served because the renter or the site tenant terminated or repudiated the residential rental agreement or the site agreement; and




        (e)        determine compensation payable after a renter or a site tenant has given the residential rental provider or the site owner a notice of intention to vacate under section 91ZB, 91ZC or 207S.
Note
Section 91ZH applies to advanced payments of rent by a renter to a residential rental provider after the rented premises have been abandoned by the renter.
        (4)        If the Tribunal is determining an application under section 210 in respect of a claim by a residential rental provider for unpaid rent in a residential rental agreement for a fixed term of more than 5 years that has been terminated early, the Tribunal may not award an amount of compensation in excess of a maximum of one month's rent under the agreement for each 12 month period of the unexpired term of the agreement.
        (5)        In the case of an application referred to in subsection (1)(a), the Tribunal must take into account whether a renter who was required to give written notice under section 72AA has given that notice to the residential rental provider.

        (1)        On an application under section 215A(1)

        (a)        the notice to vacate has been validly given; and
        (b)        in the case of a caravan park closure, the parties entitled to compensation are eligible residents; and

        (b)        is not to be, or is unable to be, relocated by the eligible resident or eligible site tenant.




        (3)        If a dwelling is to be relocated by an eligible resident or eligible site tenant, the Tribunal, in determining the amount of compensation payable by the caravan park owner or the site owner, is to have regard to the likely cost of the following—
        (a)        removing the dwelling from the site, including disconnection of services;

        (4)        After a dwelling is relocated by an eligible resident or eligible site tenant, the owner of the dwelling may apply to the Tribunal for an order that the caravan park owner or site owner compensate the owner of the dwelling for any of the following—
        (a)        the cost of any repair or damage to the dwelling resulting from the relocation of the dwelling, other than damage due to the negligence of any person engaged by the owner of the dwelling to dismantle, transport or relocate that dwelling;
        (b)        any reasonable costs that were reasonably incurred as a result of the relocation of the dwelling and its contents.
        (5)        On an application under subsection (4), the Tribunal may order that the caravan park owner or the site owner compensate the owner of the dwelling for any costs referred to in subsection (4).
        (6)        If a dwelling is not to be relocated or is unable to be relocated by an eligible resident or eligible site tenant, the Tribunal, in determining the amount of compensation payable by the caravan park owner or the site owner, is to have regard to—
        (a)        if the eligible resident or eligible site tenant has agreed to transfer ownership of the dwelling, free of encumbrances, to the caravan park owner or the site owner (as the case requires), the loss of residency, being a reasonable amount calculated having regard to the following—
        (i)        the original purchase price paid for the dwelling by the eligible resident or eligible site tenant; 
        (ii)        the current on-site market value of the dwelling determined as if the closure were not to occur;
        (iii)        the rent and any other fees for the site payable by the eligible resident or eligible site tenant;
        (iv)        any other prescribed matter; and
        (b)        the likely reasonable costs of removing the contents from the dwelling and the relocation costs of the eligible resident or eligible site tenant, being a reasonable amount calculated having regard to the following—
        (i)        the costs of removal of the possessions of the eligible resident or eligible site tenant;
        (ii)        the likely inconvenience to the eligible resident or eligible site tenant due to having to arrange alternative residential accommodation;
        (iii)        the length of time the eligible resident or eligible site tenant has occupied the site;
        (iv)        any other matter the Tribunal considers relevant.
        (7)        A park closure compensation order must specify the date by which the compensation under the order is to be paid to the eligible resident or eligible site tenant (as the case requires) which must not be less than 30 days before the end of the notice period specified in the relevant notice to vacate.
        (8)        If a park closure compensation order is made in relation to the relocation of a dwelling and the eligible resident or eligible site tenant (as the case requires) relocates the dwelling before the caravan park owner or the site owner pays the compensation payable under the order, the caravan park owner or the site owner, as the case requires, remains liable to pay the compensation under the order.

Minister's second reading speech—
Legislative Assembly: 30 October 1997
Legislative Council: 20 November 1997
The long title for the Bill for this Act was "to re-enact with amendments the law relating to residential tenancies, rooming houses and caravan parks, to provide for a Residential Tenancies Tribunal and a Residential Tenancies Bond Authority, to repeal the Residential Tenancies Act 1980, the Caravan Parks and Movable Dwellings Act 1988 and the Rooming Houses Act 1990 and for other purposes."
The Residential Tenancies Act 1997 was assented to on 23 December 1997 and came into operation as follows:
Part 1 (sections 1–25) on 23 December 1997: section 2(1); rest of Act on 1 July 1998: Government Gazette 18 June 1998 page 1512.
INTERPRETATION OF LEGISLATION ACT 1984 (ILA)
Style changes
Section 54A of the ILA authorises the making of the style changes set out in Schedule 1 to that Act.
References to ILA s. 39B
Sidenotes which cite ILA s. 39B refer to section 39B of the ILA which provides that where an undivided section or clause of a Schedule is amended by the insertion of one or more subsections or subclauses, the original section or clause becomes subsection or subclause (1) and is amended by the insertion of the expression "(1)" at the beginning of the original section or clause.
Interpretation
As from 1 January 2001, amendments to section 36 of the ILA have the following effects:
•        Headings
All headings included in an Act which is passed on or after 1 January 2001 form part of that Act.  Any heading inserted in an Act which was passed before 1 January 2001, by an Act passed on or after 1 January 2001, forms part of that Act.  This includes headings to Parts, Divisions or Subdivisions in a Schedule; sections; clauses; items; tables; columns; examples; diagrams; notes or forms.  See section 36(1A)(2A).
•        Examples, diagrams or notes
All examples, diagrams or notes included in an Act which is passed on or after 1 January 2001 form part of that Act.  Any examples, diagrams or notes inserted in an Act which was passed before 1 January 2001, by an Act passed on or after 1 January 2001, form part of that Act.  See section 36(3A).
•        Punctuation
All punctuation included in an Act which is passed on or after 1 January 2001 forms part of that Act.  Any punctuation inserted in an Act which was passed before 1 January 2001, by an Act passed on or after 1 January 2001, forms part of that Act.  See section 36(3B).
•        Provision numbers
All provision numbers included in an Act form part of that Act, whether inserted in the Act before, on or after 1 January 2001.  Provision numbers include section numbers, subsection numbers, paragraphs and subparagraphs.  See section 36(3C).
•        Location of "legislative items"
A "legislative item" is a penalty, an example or a note.  As from 13 October 2004, a legislative item relating to a provision of an Act is taken to be at the foot of that provision even if it is preceded or followed by another legislative item that relates to that provision.  For example, if a penalty at the foot of a provision is followed by a note, both of these legislative items will be regarded as being at the foot of that provision.  See section 36B.
•        Other material
Any explanatory memorandum, table of provisions, endnotes, index and other material printed after the Endnotes does not form part of an Act.  
See section 36(3)(3D)(3E).
